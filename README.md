# GoldbergPolyhedron
Generates a icosahedral golberg polyhedron of variable size m, n

WIP
I'm simply refactoring with respect to UE4 naming conventions.
I intend to demonstrate several common use cases where this geometry offers substantial benefits over the standard shpere mesh, despite the additional overhead up front.
